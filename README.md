# KnapsackProblem
Six complete variants of the knapsack problem together with an extense complexity analysis and comparison between them.

Knapsack: Fill the backpack as much as possible (weight).

Knapsack value: Each object will have assigned a value. In this case we seek to fill the backpack maximizing the total value of the backpack.

Diverse knapsack: For this problem we want to put in the backpack as many objects as possible.

Fractional knapsack: Here we can take only part of the object.

The knapsack with several objects: Instead of having a single element of each object, we have a certain amount of each and the solution is not only to take the object or not, but also how many we take from each object.

The knapsack with infinite objects: We have an infinite amount of objects.
